Bartering has never been easier! LetsTrade is an app that allows friendly trading of items or skills on campuses or within communities.

Give away stuff you no longer need & get new things you may not have known you wanted!

You start out with a fixed number of points and you trade skills/items you have for more points or skills/items. The app allows you to browse through items other people are willing to trade in and make offers on things you would be interested in having.

Right now, this is available as an Android app, but watch out for a web interface and an iOS app.

Future extensions:

We had a lot of ideas for the app that we were'nt able to complete in 35 hours. We do plan on developing some of these soon.
